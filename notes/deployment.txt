First, because MongoDB maps all data files to a virtual address space, all production
deployments should be run on 64-bit machines.

Be sure to select hardware
(virtual or otherwise) with enough RAM to contain your frequently used indexes
plus your working data set.

The minimum recommended deployment topology is a three-member replica set. At
least two members of the set must be data-storing (non-arbiter) replicas residing on
separate machines. The third member may be yet another replica or it can be an arbiter,
which doesn’t necessarily need its own machine; you can run an arbiter on an
application server, for instance.

If you expect your working set size to exceed RAM from the start, then you may
want to begin with a sharded cluster, which consists of at least two replica sets.

For production deployments, a single server isn’t recommended, even if journaling is
enabled. Having just one machine complicates backup and recovery, and when there’s
a server failure, there’s nothing to fail over to.

MONGOIMPORT AND MONGOEXPORT
Bundled with MongoDB are two utilities for importing and exporting data:
mongoimport and mongoexport. You can use mongoimport to import JSON, CSV, and
TSV files. This is frequently useful for loading data from relational databases into
MongoDB:
$ mongoimport -d stocks -c values --type csv --headerline stocks.csv

Use mongoexport to export all of a collection’s data to a JSON or CSV file:
$ mongoexport -d stocks -c values -o stocks.csv
