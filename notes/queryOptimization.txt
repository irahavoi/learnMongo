Identifying slow queries:
Though the requirements will vary per application, it’s safe to assume that for most apps, queries
shouldn’t take much longer than 100 milliseconds.

The MongoDB logger has this
assumption ingrained, since it prints a warning whenever any operation, including a
query, takes more than 100 ms. The logs, therefore, are the first place you should look
for slow queries.
