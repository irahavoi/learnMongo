Atomic document processing:
findAndModify - allows you to atomically update a document and return it in the same round trip.

For instance, you can use findAndModify to build job queues and state machines. You can then use these primitive
constructs to implement basic transactional semantics, which greatly expand the
range of applications you can build using MongoDB. With these transaction-like features,
you can construct an entire e-commerce site on MongoDB—not just the product
content, but the checkout mechanism and the inventory management as well.

findAndModify - finds and modifies only one object!!
db.users.findAndModify({ query :{},  update : {"$set" : {"role": "admin"}}})


Multidocument Updates:
An update will, by default, only update the first document matched by its query selector.
To update multiple documents:
 db.users.update({}, {$addToSet:{tags:'vip'}},false,true)

 notice true as the 4th argument - it tells mongodb to update all matching users, not just the 1st one.

Upserts:
It’s common to need to insert if an item doesn’t exist but update it if it does.
If the query selector matches, the update takes place normally. But if no document matches
the query selector, a new document will be inserted:

db.users.update({username: 'irahavoi'}, {$addToSet: {tags: 'vip'}}, true)

upserts deal with only one document at a time.


------------------------Update Operators---------------------------------------------
$inc - increments or decrements a numeric value.
db.users.update({}, {$inc: {age: 1}}, false,true)

$set and $unset

$rename - If you need to change the name of a key, use $rename

db.users.update({}, {$rename: {'tags' : 'attrs'}}, false,true)

Array update operators:
$push - add a single value to an array
$pushAll - supports adding a list of values

db.users.update({}, {$pushAll: {'attrs': ['js, android, java']}}, false, true)

$addToSet - it also adds a value to the array, but only if it does not exist.
db.products.update({slug: 'shovel'}, {$addToSet: {'tags': 'tools'}})
If you need to add more than one value to an array uniquely in the same operation,
then you must use $addToSet with the $each operator:
db.products.update({slug: 'shovel'},
{$addToSet: {'tags': {$each: ['tools', 'dirt', 'steel']}}})

$pop - will remove the last item pushed
{$pop: {'tags': 1} - remove last element
{$pop: {'tags': -1} - remove first element


$pull and $pullAll -
With $pull, you specify exactly which array element to remove by value, not by position.
db.products.update({slug: 'shovel'}, {$pullAll {'tags': ['dirt', 'garden']}})


Positional updates:
update = {$set: {'line_items.$.quantity': 5}}


findAndModify:
 query—A document query selector. Defaults to {}.
 update—A document specifying an update. Defaults to {}.
 remove—A Boolean value that, when true, removes the object and then returns
it. Defaults to false.
 new—A Boolean that, if true, returns the modified document as it appears after
the update has been applied. Defaults to false.
 sort—A document specifying a sort direction. Because findAndModify will
modify only one document at a time, the sort option can be used to help control
which matching document is processed. For example, you might sort by
{created_at: -1} to process to most recently created matching document.
 fields—If you only need to return a subset of fields, use this option to specify
them. This is especially helpful with larger documents. The fields are specified
just as they would be in any query. See the section on fields in chapter 5 for
examples.
 upsert—A Boolean that, when true, treats findAndModify as an upsert. If the
document sought doesn’t exist, it’ll be created. Note that if you want to return
the newly created document, you also need to specify {new: true}.
